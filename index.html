                       I took the liberty of returning to the battlefield to retrieve the vampire brides' remains for study. Such specimens rarely present themselves for examination, and I suspect their condition may reveal crucial intelligence about the undead threat we face. I will keep you apprised of any findings that emerge from my research. How curious that a being touched by undeath should prove so effective at thwarting vampiric predators—your divine powers clearly burned particularly bright against those pale-skinned seductresses.</p>
